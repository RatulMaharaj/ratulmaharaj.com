## The sad reality

I recently posted a job ad for a junior developer role. After just 2 days, overwhelmed by the number of applications, I closed the ad. I received **634** applications. **407** came through LinkedIn, **227** via Indeed. 

Six hundred and thirty four. That number hit me hard. On one level, I felt proud and excited that so many people wanted to work for Looped. But honestly, it was also **deeply sobering**. It’s a reflection of just how difficult the job market is right now, and how bad the unemployment rate is in South Africa.  

Looking through hundreds of CVs was a bit of a reality check for me. For every person who got an interview, **over 100 didn’t**. But I learned a lot from the process and hope that I can share something here that will help you in your job search.

## What I looked for (and what matters less than you think)

Yes, a degree from a top university helps. It gets my attention a little faster. But it’s not the only thing that matters - and it’s not the reason I selected the people I did.

I cared more about:
- **Curiosity** – Are you genuinely interested in coding? Do you learn because you want to, not just because someone told you to?
- **Initiative** – Have you built something without being asked? Even small things count. A personal project, portfolio website, or even just an app relating to a hobby of yours.
- **Effort** – Did you take the time to present yourself well? That alone already sets you apart.

Some of the strongest candidates didn’t have the best degrees on their CV. But they showed me that they were passionate about code, about learning, and about growing.

## Some Practical Advice (If You're Still Job Hunting)

### The Deceptively Simple Screening Questions

Most people used the LinkedIn Quick Apply feature to apply. It's actually a great way to apply for jobs quickly and easily. That said, what you might not know, is that recruiters are using those initial questions to screen and automatically reject applicants. 

I went through all my automatically rejected and 'maybe' applications and found that many of them were potentially a really good fit. They just didn't answer the screening questions in the way LinkedIn thought they should (or maybe I didn't set the questions up correctly). Regardless, most hiring managers will probably not be willing to go through hundreds of auto rejections if they already have a large number of 'good fits' from LinkedIn.

The answers you provide to the screening questions are possibly the most important part of your application - so think carefully about how your answers compare to the role's requirements and what the company might be looking for. 

### Your CV

I saw the same CV template hundreds of times. Most were just blocks of plain text.

- Try using some basic layout or design tweaks to make it your own. A simple thing like adding a little colour and picking a good legible font makes a huge difference to help you stand out.
- Put your **GitHub or portfolio links at the top**. You have to it them extremely easy to find. Like with social media, your goal should be to drive the hiring manager to your work so that you can show them what you're capable of.
- Order your experience or education with your most recent or most relevant experiences at the top of the section.
- Highlight your skills, but avoid using arbitrary ranking systems to rate your skills. 4/5 stars at excel doesn't really mean anything to anyone.

It's a tough market out there, and you need to everything you can to stand out.

### Portfolio Websites

I'm a big fan of portfolio websites. They're a excellent way to show off your work and to showcase your skills. If you're able to create one, you definitely should - it's a great way to stand out.

### GitHub

The next round of my hiring process was a code challenge. I gave a few candidates a simple task to complete. I'm not going to share the task here, but I'll share some of the things I looked for.

Copied projects won’t get you far. I didn't look for flashy work - I was looking for signs that **you wrote the code**. 

I love AI, and I'm a big advocate for using it to help you learn and grow. But it's insanely easy to tell when an entire project has just been auto generated. For one thing, there will be a bunch of submissions that have the same generic and identical elements that your project has. I got a bunch of submission that all had 3 identical component file names. Coincidence? I think not. 

Use AI, but please be smart about it.

Commit history is extremely important. I looked at commit history to:
- Understand your thought process
- See how what changes you made over time or if you just copied and 'uploaded' someone else's work
- Are able to succinctly explain the changes you made

The last thing I looked at was the repo README. It's your chance to show the hiring manager that you understood the challenge well and that you're capable of not just writing clean code, but also clear and easy to follow documentation.

## Final Thoughts

I know how hard it is out there. I felt that, reading through application after application. I also know how disheartening it can be to keep trying and to keep getting rejected.

When I posted the job ad, I wasn't expecting to have to reject 633 people. I honestly hated having to do that. It's probably one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do.

If you're in that space, please don’t give up. Keep building. Keep learning. Keep applying. You never know when the right opportunity will open up.
